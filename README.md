## Hello World!
สวัสดี! I'm **Palapon Soontornpas**, but I'm going by the name **p0ndja**. Since I'm from Thailand, my primary language will be Thai, but I also fluent in English as well.

Currently, I am pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at [Faculty of Engineering, Khon Kaen University, Thailand](https://www.en.kku.ac.th/web/en/), with a passion for web and mobile application development. My technical expertise includes PHP, Kotlin, Java, and JavaScript (both client- and server-side), which I’ve honed through hands-on experience in various projects.

Since 2016, I've been studying programming through the [**p0ndja/SMDMain**](https://github.com/p0ndja/SMD_Main) project. It's just a simple Java Plugin for Minecraft, a game I've been playing since I was a kid, but it's the start of my computer programming studies. This project has been updated since then because it is valuable to me and shows how far I have come.

Great to see you here, have a nice day! :)
