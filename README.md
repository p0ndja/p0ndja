## Hello World!
My name is **Palapon Soontornpas**, but I'm going by the alias **PondJaáµ€á´´**. Since I'm from Thailand, my primary language will be Thai, but I'll make my programming more foreign. ðŸ’»

I'm a Moderate Programmer who can code in C, C++, Java, and Python. I'm also a Web Developer who can code in HTML, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript. ðŸ–¥

Since2016, I've been studying programming through the [**p0ndja/SMDMain**](https://github.com/p0ndja/SMD_Main) project. It's just a simple Java Plugin for Minecraft, a game I've been playing since I was a kid, but it's the start of my computer programming studies. This project has been updated since then because it is valuable to me and shows how far I have come. ðŸŽ®

Since I'm not a professional, my code can be messy, dirty, and confusing at times. So, if you want me to change what you want or fix a bug you find, feel free to pull your request. ðŸ”Ž

## My Recent Project
<a href="https://grader.ga/" target="_blank">![Image](https://i.imgur.com/Vrj8O8s.jpg)</a>
The [**CoE30-KKU/graderga**](https://github.com/CoE30-KKU/graderga) project is the most recent project that I currently working on. This project mainly target to create a custom made-for-student grader for grading computer programming language. The initial idea was aimed at support only Python, but our team decided to extend support for Java, C and C++, and will be extended in the future if it needs.

You can try a demo here: [**grader.ga**](https://grader.ga/)

This project is currently under development, so it's not fully functional and can't guarantee that's working 100 percent correctly, If you found any bug please report at its specified in the website.
