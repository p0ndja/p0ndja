## Hello World!
My name is **Palapon Soontornpas**, but I'm going by the alias **PondJaáµ€á´´**. Since I'm from Thailand, my primary language will be Thai, but I'll make my programming more foreign. ðŸ’»

I'm a Moderate Programmer who can code in C, C++, Java, and Python. I'm also a Web Developer who can code in HTML, PHP, CSS, and JavaScript. ðŸ–¥

Since2016, I've been studying programming through the [**p0ndja/SMDMain**](https://github.com/p0ndja/SMD_Main) project. It's just a simple Java Plugin for Minecraft, a game I've been playing since I was a kid, but it's the start of my computer programming studies. This project has been updated since then because it is valuable to me and shows how far I have come. ðŸŽ®

Since I'm not a professional, my code can be messy, dirty, and confusing at times. So, if you want me to change what you want or fix a bug you find, feel free to pull your request. ðŸ”Ž

## My Recent Project
<a href="https://grader.ga/" target="_blank">![Image](https://i.imgur.com/Vrj8O8s.jpg)</a>
The most recent project on which I am currently working is the [**CoE30-KKU/graderga**](https://github.com/CoE30-KKU/graderga) project. The main goal of this project is to build a custom made-for-student grader for computer programming language grading. The original plan was to support only Python, but our team decided to add support for Java, C, and C++, which will be expanded as needed in the future.

You can try a demo here: [**grader.ga**](https://grader.ga/)

This project is still in progress, so it isn't completely functional yet, and we can't guarantee that all is working correctly. If you find a bug, please report it to the address listed on the website.
