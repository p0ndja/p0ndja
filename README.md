## Hello World!
My name is **Palapon Soontornpas**, but I supposed to use pseudonym as **'PondJaáµ€á´´'**. My main language will be in Thai because I'm from Thailand, But I will make my programming in  ðŸ’»

I'm a Moderate Programmer that can programming in C, C++, Java, Python and I also a Web Developer, in HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript. ðŸ–¥

I started learning programming since 2016 from the [**p0ndja/SMDMain**](https://github.com/p0ndja/SMD_Main) project. It's just a simple Minecraft's Java Plugin, the game that I started playing since I was young, but it's the beginning of my studying in computer programming. From then to now, this project still being updated because it's important for me and show how far I come. ðŸŽ®

Because I'm not the professional, my code sometimes still messy, dirty and complicated. So, Feel free to pull your request if you want me to change what you want or what bug you found. ðŸ”Ž
